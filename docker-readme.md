# Dockerfile and docker-compose notes

Notes:
This branch was created to demo using Docker for local development. Key take-aways are the Dockerfile setup for local development, which is different from what's needed for a prod container, and that the docker-compose setup was necessary for binding the project directories to help with change detection.
